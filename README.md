# maze-runner

This is a recent project of mine. I have been interested in NPC behaviors, and I wanted to explore pathfinding.

In this code, I've come up with an algorithm to exhaust the optimal moves by determining whether the character gets "trapped" going a particular route. I am by no means an expert at this stuff, and I know that it's not the most optimized algorithm.
